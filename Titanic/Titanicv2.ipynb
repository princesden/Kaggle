    "Introduction\n",
    "--------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "When applying Machine Learning algorithms, it's critical to always keep in mind the problem we're trying to solve. In most cases, the most accurate and robust model might be what you're looking for. But sometimes we need to actually get insights from the available data and in these cases transparent, easy to understand models like *Decision Trees* will greatly simplify our task.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we need to build a model that will be directly used for some task and **only show it's end results**, then we don't really care about building some kind of \"blackbox\" if it's accurate enough (image or speech recognition for example). That's why advanced techniques such as [*Deep Learning*][1] or [*Ensemble Learning*][2]  (cf. [Anisotropic Kernel][3]) are commonly used for complex tasks. But remember the KISS principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid)! Always consider the complexity/accuracy trade-off: complex techniques should only be used if they offer significant improvements. Simpler models are also less prone to over-fitting and tend to generalise better.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if we're using Machine Learning to actually **get insights from the data**, \"blackbox\" models are almost useless and it's best to stick with simpler, transparent techniques. Let's take the case of a supermarket looking to better understand customer behaviour: the straightforward [*Apriori*][4] algorithm can quickly offer relevant insights like \"80% of customers who bought a suit also bought a tie\" so they may try to increase tie sales by offering a discount to clients buying a suit . Of course, a complex classification algorithm will do better at identifying the customers who bought a tie by taking into account more features, but is that really useful for the supermarket?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Decision Trees* can also help a lot when we need to understanding the data. A good example is the traditional problem of classifying Iris flowers included in the [sklearn documentation][5], were we can learn about the characteristics of each flower type in the resulting tree. Given their transparency and relatively low computational cost, *Decision Trees* are also very useful for exploring your data before applying other algorithms. They're helpful for checking the quality of engineered features and identifying the most relevant ones by visualising the resulting tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main downsides of *Decision Trees* are their tendency to over-fit, their inability to grasp relationships between features, and the use of greedy learning algorithms (not guaranteed to find the global optimal model). Using them in a [*Random Forest*][6] helps mitigate some of this issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this short introduction to *Decision Trees* and their place in Machine Learning, let's see how to apply them for the Titanic challenge. First, we're going to prepare the dataset and discuss the most relevant features. We'll then find the best tree depth to avoid over-fitting, generate the final model, and explain how to visualise the resulting tree.\n",

    "Thanks to this overview we can see that our dataset needs some treatment. The class *Survived* is already in binary format so no additional formatting is necessary, but features like *Name*, *Ticket* or *Cabin* need to be adapted for the problem we're trying to solve, and we can also engineer some new features by merging or regrouping existing ones. There's already extended work on this so we're just using one the best approches out there (credit to [Sina][1], [Anisotropic][2] and also [Megan Risdal][3] for the suggestion of the \"Title\" feature).\n",

    "Thanks to these rules we can infer some insights about the shipwreck. \"Misters\" seem to have honoured their title and sacrificed themselves in favour on women and men with more exotic titles like \"Master\" or \"Dr\".  We can also note that smaller families had better chances to survive, maybe because bigger families tried to stick together or look for missing members and therefore didn't had places left in the lifeboats. Finally, we can observe that 3rd class passengers had also less chances to survive so probably passengers belonging to upper social social classes were privileged, or simply 3rd class cabins may have been further away of the lifeboats.\n",
